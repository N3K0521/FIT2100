//What can you say about the output?
The order of the output may differ.

//What has happened to the pattern of executions of the two processes?
As the execution time decreases, the parent process is more likely to complete
earlier than its child processes.


//Are there any changes?
The parent process and child process execute with interleaving.

//Does this result in anything different?
no

//find a value for the limit
the limit is 1000000000 -> only 2 output at one time (but slowly)

//using sleep(2):

//What differences in the output do you notice?
Simillar to using wait(), sleep() can also let the parent and child processes
execute alternately

//Summary:
Parent process would keep execute while a new child process is forked when the code of execution
is relatively large or the processes sleep for a certain time. However, the output order may differ when
the code is small (e.g.: with a small limit).
depends on different scheduling of processes each time.
